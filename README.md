# EmployeeReinbursementSystem

## Description

EmployeeReinbursementSystem is a web portal that allows for employees to file reinbursement requests for business related purchases. Users can specify the reason, amount, and upload a picture for the request. Managers can then then approve or deny the request while also be able to act as an employee account.


## Manager
- Managers are in charge of approving requests.
- A manager cannot approve their own requests.
- Managers can view all requests but only approve them if they are assigned to them.
- Managers are assigned users when an employee account is created.
- Managers also can file for requests much like Employees
- Managers can create new employee or manager accounts.


## Employee
- Employees can create a request by proving the reason, reinbursement amount, and an image.
- Employees can update their personal information (such as changing their first and lastname).
- Employees can view their approved, pending, and denied requests.
